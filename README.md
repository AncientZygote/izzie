Tutorials, theory development, etc. related to the Isabelle Proof Assistant
We wrote a tutorial for new users of the Isabelle Proof Assistant. It features many screen shots and detailed hand-holding as we walk through a simple proof that the square root of a prime number cannot be a rational number. This is a LaTeX typeset pdf document with hyperlink cross-referencing, index and cites to many useful papers providing additional information: [Isabelle Tutorial](https://github.com/AncientZygote/izzie/blob/master/IsabelleTutorial.pdf)
